# Who we are and what we do
[Parcandi](https://parcandi.com/ch-en/) is an innovative startup aiming to make parking easier and faster for you. For this, we provide to you parking space in safe environments else not being available to the public. 
# Where we come from
Parcandi started as a pilot project at [Baloise Insurance](https://github.com/baloise) around the topic of sharing parking space. Everyone knows: Looking for a parking lot is annoying. It costs time and nerves, results in stressy situations in cities, und [Corsin Sulser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corsin-sulser/) thought: This doesn't have to be that way. Not only at [Baloise Insurance](https://github.com/baloise), but also at lots of enterprises and private real estates parking lots often are by far not used to capacity. This results in unnecessary cost. Why not making those available to the public?
[Corsin Sulser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corsin-sulser/), a former [Baloise Insurance](https://github.com/baloise) employee, elaborated his vision, enabling the easy sharing of empty parking lots, by the internal innovation initiative «Baloise Kickbox». Together with a team, he developed and successfully deployed it to the market.
Today, [Corsin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corsin-sulser/) is CEO of the [Parcandi](https://parcandi.com/ch-en/) startup, who's team makes this novel parking space management approach available to a broader public.
