# Who we are and what we do
[Parcandi](https://parcandi.com/ch-en/) is an innovative startup aiming to make parking easier and faster for you. For this, we provide parking space in safe environments else not being available to the public. 
# Where we come from
Parcandi started as a pilot project at [Baloise Insurance](https://github.com/baloise) around the topic of sharing parking space. Everyone knows: Looking for a parking lot is annoying. It costs time and nerves and results in stressy situations in cities. This is when [Corsin Sulser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corsin-sulser/) thought: This doesn't have to be that way. Not only at [Baloise Insurance](https://github.com/baloise), but also at lots of other enterprises and private real estates, parking lots often are by far not used to capacity. This results in unnecessary cost. Why not making those unused parking lots available to the public?

[Corsin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corsin-sulser/), a former [Baloise Insurance](https://github.com/baloise) employee, elaborated his vision by the internal innovation initiative «Baloise Kickbox»: Enabling the easy sharing of empty parking lots. Together with a team, he developed and successfully deployed it to the market.

Today, [Corsin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corsin-sulser/) is the CEO of the [Parcandi](https://parcandi.com/ch-en/) startup, who's team makes this novel approach to parking space management available to a broader public.
